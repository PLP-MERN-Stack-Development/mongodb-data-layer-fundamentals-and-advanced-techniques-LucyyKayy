# PLP Bookstore Assignment

## Overview
This project is about learning MongoDB.  
I created a database called **plp_bookstore** with a collection called **books**.  
I practiced CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing.

## How to Run
1. Open MongoDB Atlas or Compass.  
2. Insert the sample books using `insert_books.js`.  
3. Run the queries from `queries.js`.
